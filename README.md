# ConsoleCalculator
Console calculator for Windows written in fasm
I had got the task in university and was sure that I could find the program on GitHub. But there are a lot of GUI calculators and no console.
If somebody else has to write the same program he/she can use my peace of code as example.
Addition, suptraction, multiplication and two ways of division are implemented.
